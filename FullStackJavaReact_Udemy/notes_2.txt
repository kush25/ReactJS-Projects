While importing the CSS file, we can simply do, import "./styles.css" because it is a normal css file and not JavaScript.

In React all JS attributes are written as camelcase so onclick() => onClick() in react.

In JSX anything that is JavaScript is written in {}.

Instead of passing increment as method in event onClick pass as reference like do
onClick ={increment}

Ok, so now if we create a class component instead of function component then we can include the function inside the class itself instead of declaring it globally.
And when we declare the function inside the class we do not require function keyword.
and function is called with this.functionname.


So instead of this:
function CounterApp(){

    return(

        <div className="counter">
        <button onClick={increment} +1</button>

           <span className="spnctr">0</span>

        </div>
    )

}

function increment(){
    console.log('increment');
 
}


Do this,

import React,{Component} from 'react'
import "./counter.css"

class CounterApp extends Component{
render(){
        return(

            <div className="counter">
            <button onClick={this.increment}>+1</button>

            <span className="spnctr">0</span>

            </div>
        )
        
    }

    increment(){
        console.log('increment');
      
    }
}


Now states:
Define initial states in a constructor
In constructor before you use anything please declare super();

constructor (){
super(); =>  //Mandatory
this.state ={...}
}

when we want a function inconnection to constructor to perform we need to define it with constructor and bind it, like
this.funcname = this.funcname.bind(this)

always set the state to use a state never declare it directly.
